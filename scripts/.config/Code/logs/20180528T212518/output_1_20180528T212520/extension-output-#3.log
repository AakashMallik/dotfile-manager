[Info  - 21:25:23] ESLint server is running.
[Info  - 21:25:23] 
Failed to load the ESLint library for the document /home/humble_d/Projects/react-native/samsung_remote_app/components/Home/Home.js

To use ESLint please install eslint by running 'npm install eslint' in the workspace folder samsung_remote_app
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn instead of npm set the setting `"eslint.packageManager": "yarn"`

Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder samsung_remote_app by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
